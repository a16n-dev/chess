# Chess
This is a simple chess UI (and even simpler chess engine) implemented in Typescript

See it in action [here](chess-jet-mu.vercel.app)

# Design
All of the game logic is implemented using a functional programming approach, rather than an object-oriented approach.

### Things that still need to be implemented for the game itself
- [ ] En passant moves
- [ ] Draws by repetition
- [ ] Draws by insufficient material
- [ ] Draws by the 50-move rule
